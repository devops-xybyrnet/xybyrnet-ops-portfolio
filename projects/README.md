# Projects

This directory contains concrete systems built on top of the **xybyrnet core architecture**.

Projects represent:
- Deployed services
- Automation tools
- Bots and integrations
- Infrastructure experiments promoted to production

Each project is:
- Built on the same baseline architecture
- Operated on live systems
- Documented with supporting evidence

Projects are **not isolated demos**.  
They exist to produce measurable outcomes captured in `/evidence`.
