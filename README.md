# xybyrnet Ops Portfolio

## Overview

**xybyrnet** is a personal infrastructure platform designed to document, validate, and demonstrate real-world Linux system administration and operations practices.

This repository serves as a **professional operations portfolio**, providing architectural context, audit history, and evidence of hands-on systems work performed on a self-owned and self-managed server environment.

The focus is not theoretical learning, but **applied operations**: building, operating, auditing, and improving a live system over time.

---

## What xybyrnet Is

- A minimal, Linux-first operational core
- A repeatable and auditable system architecture
- A learning platform built on real infrastructure, not simulations
- A foundation for automation, service hosting, and integrations

xybyrnet prioritizes:
- Stability over novelty
- Observability over abstraction
- Documentation over assumption
- Discipline over speed

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository is **documentation-first**.

It exists to:
- Explain architectural decisions
- Track system audits and operational milestones
- Present evidence of applied system administration work
- Provide context for projects deployed on the xybyrnet platform

Code and scripts live in supporting repositories.  
This repository provides the **why**, **how**, and **proof**.

## Repository Structure


---

## Operating Principles

- Linux-first, terminal-driven workflows
- Minimal services, explicitly configured
- Changes are logged, reviewed, and auditable
- Automation is introduced only after understanding the manual process
- Every system claim must be verifiable

---

## Status

This platform is actively evolving.

All changes are intentional, documented, and tied to operational learning objectives.
